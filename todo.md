    1.Fetch to http://localhost:3005/books. You should get a response that is an array of multiple book objects that look like this:

{
   "id": 1,
   "title": "The Great Gatsby",
   "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
   "img": "https://mppl.org/wp-content/uploads/0-214x300.jpg"
}

    2.Render a list of books that show the book title and book img

    3.Clicking on a book in the Book List should add it to the Book Shelf

    4.Clicking on a book in the Book Shelf should remove it from the Book Shelf

    5.Add a controlled form that allows the user to add a book to the Book List (this should NOT persist)
    
    BONUS: Each book can only be added to Book Shelf one time (Book Shelf should not have duplicate books)
